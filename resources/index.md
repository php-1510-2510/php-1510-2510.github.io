### R Programming Language

[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a statistical programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R (initially), we will primarily be using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/), an interactive development environment (IDE).

 We will mostly be using a browser based version of RStudio on a remote server but you can also install a local version of the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

### git 


Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It lets you track who made changes to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your code on [github](https://github.com/).

* OSX - install Git for Mac by downloading and running [the installer](http://git-scm.com/downloads) or install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and use it to install git via `brew install git`. 

* Unix/Linux - you should be able to install git via your prefered package manager (if it is not already installed).

* Windows - install Git for Windows by download and running the git for windows [installer](http://msysgit.github.io/). This will provide you with git, the bash shell, and ssh in windows.
