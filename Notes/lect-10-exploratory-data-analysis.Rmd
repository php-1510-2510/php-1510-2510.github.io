# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- We have already started the basic steps to exploratory data analysis. 
- So far we have:
    - Looked at Data
    - Summarized characteristics
    - Graphed relationships and distributions. 


--- .class #id

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- First step
- Know your dataset. 

 

--- .class #id

## Checkout the Data

```{R, eval=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
glimpse(diamonds)
str(diamonds)
```

--- .class #id

## `glimpse()` Function

```{R, echo=F}
library(ggplot2)
glimpse(diamonds)
```


--- .class #id

## `str()` Function

```{R, echo=F}
str(diamonds)
```

--- .class #id

## Data Look

- Using the `glimpse()` function and `str()` function. 
- This shows you the variables, what type they are and some information on values. 
- This is the first step you take with any dataset. 

--- .class #id

## Exploring the Dataset

- The rest of exploring comes from summaries and visualizations. 
- We tend to use different statistical summaries and visualizations depending on the type of data:
    - Categorical (Discrete)
    - Continuous

--- .class #id


## Descriptive Statistics

| Categorical | Continuous| 
| ----- | ----- | 
| Frequency | Mean |
| Proportion | Median |
| | Variance | 
| | Standard Deviation | 
| | Minimum | 
| | Maximum | 
| | Percentiles | 
| | etc. | 

--- .class #id

## Graphical Methods

| Categorical | Continuous| 
| ----- | ----- | 
| Bar Plots | Histograms | 
| | Boxplots | 
| | etc. |


--- .class #id

## Again with all of them?

- In the class on summarizing data we actually showed how to do these counts and basic stats. 
- In the class on data visualizations we showed how to make graphs. 
- What should we be doing for EDA? 

--- .class #id

## Purpose of EDA

- For now we will consider the purpose of EDA to be:
    - Visualizing the distribution.
    - Understanding the center. 
    - Understanding the variation.
    - Relationships of variables. 
    


--- .class #id

## Purpose of EDA

- We will use EDA to:
    - Help us explore interesting features of the data. 
    - Generate more questions about data. 
    - Learn what models might be possible. 
    - Connect data to mathematical models. 
- There is **no right way** to do EDA but it is crucial to begin with this.

# EDA

--- .class #id

## Exploring Distributions

- We learned about the story of different distributions. 
- We also need to know what data looks like to help us know if the data follows that story or a similar one. 
- We will do this with some basic graphs. 

--- .class #id

## Distribution of Categorical

```{r, eval=F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
      geom_bar(aes(x=cut))
```


--- .class #id

## Distribution of Categorical

```{r eda-barplot, echo=F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
      geom_bar(aes(x=cut))
```


--- .class #id

## Counts with R

```{r}
diamonds %>%
    count(cut)
```


--- .class #id

## What do we see? 

- We can see that this not even close to a uniform distribution. 
- It appear to increase with quality. 

--- .class #id


## Distribution of Continuous

- We can do similar plots for continuous values. 


```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)
```


--- .class #id


## Distribution of Continuous

 


```{r eda-hist, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)
```

--- .class #id

## Count in R

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(cut_width(carat, 0.5))
```

--- .class #id

## What do we see? 

- There are the most in 0.25 to 0.75 carat. 
- We should try other bin sizes to see if there are differences. 

--- .class #id

## Bin size 0.1

```{r eda-hist-2, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.1)
```


--- .class #id

## Hardly any beyond 3

```{r}
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>%
                  filter(carat<3)
```


--- .class #id

## Plotting Again


```{r eda-hist-3, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds2) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.1)
```


--- .class #id

## EDA Questions

- EDA leads us to more questions as we explore. 
    - Which values are most common? Why?
    - Which value are rare? Does this make sense?
    - Any patterns in the data? 

--- .class #id

## Bin width 0.01

```{R eda-hist-4, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds2, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```

--- .class #id

## Questions raised

- Why are there more whole number than fractional carats? 
- Why are there more diamonds slightly to the right and left of each peak? 
- Why are there none larger than 3? 


--- .class #id

## Clusters

- How are the observations within each cluster similar to each other?
- How are the observations in separate clusters different from each other?
- How can you explain or describe the clusters?
- Why might the appearance of clusters be misleading?

--- .class #id

## Variation

- Variance: `r var(diamonds2$carat)`
- Standard Deviation: `r sd(diamonds2$carat)`
- Just the number doesn't tell the whole story. 
- It doesn't show us the groupings or relationships. 
- We need to understand how a distribution looks and varies within itself.

# Relationships Between Variables


--- .class #id

## Relationships Between Variables

- We will explore how variables covary together by considering the following:
    - Categorical and Continuous Variables
    - Two Categorical Variables
    - Two Continuous Variables

# Categorical and Continuous Variables

## Box plots

![R4DS](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/153b9af53b33918353fda9b691ded68cd7f62f51/5b616/images/eda-boxplot.png)



--- .class #id

## Boxplot

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

--- .class #id

## Boxplot

```{r boxplot-1, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

--- .class #id

## Boxplots: What we see

- Display a lot of information.
- We get a sense of the center by the median line. 
- We get a sense of variation based on the width of the box. 
- We get a sense of outliers by the points that are graphed. 

--- .class #id

## More Boxplots

```{R, eval=F}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

--- .class #id

## More Boxplots

```{R boxplot-3, eval=F}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

--- .class #id

## Categories

- `cut` had a natural ordering. 
- `class` does not, so we could order in our own fashion. 

--- .class #id

## Re-ordering

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot( aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy))
```


--- .class #id

## Re-ordering

```{r boxplot-4, echo=F}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot( aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy))
```


--- .class #id

## Flipping the Coordinates

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy)) +
  coord_flip()
```


--- .class #id

## Flipping the Coordinates

```{r boxplot-5, echo=F}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy)) +
  coord_flip()
```

# Two Categorical Variables

--- .class #id

## Count Plots

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_count(aes(x = cut, y = color))
```



--- .class #id

## Count Plots

```{r count, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_count(aes(x = cut, y = color))
```

--- .class #id

## Points Counted

```{r}
diamonds %>%
    count(color, cut)
```

--- .class #id

## Color Plots

```{r, eval=F}
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
    geom_tile(aes(fill = n))
```


--- .class #id

## Color Plots

```{r color, echo=F}
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
    geom_tile(aes(fill = n))
```



---  .segue bg:grey

# Two Categorical Variables


--- .class #id

## Scatterplots

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

--- .class #id

## Scatterplots

```{r scatter-1, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

--- .class #id

## What Can we See?

- There appears to be a relationship between price and carat. 
- The relationship is not exactly linear. 
- There are so many points it is hard to tell. 

--- .class #id

## Transparent Scatterplot

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price), alpha = 1 / 100)
```



--- .class #id

## Transparent Scatterplot

```{r scatter-2, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price), alpha = 1 / 100)
```


--- .class #id

## Binning Observations

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds2) +
  geom_bin2d( aes(x = carat, y = price))
```


--- .class #id 

## Binning Observations

```{r scatter-color, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds2) +
  geom_bin2d(aes(x = carat, y = price))
```


--- .class #id

## Turning to Categorical

```{R, eval=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds2, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(carat, 0.1)), varwidth=TRUE)
```


--- .class #id

## Turning to Categorical

```{R scatter-binned, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds2, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(carat, 0.1)), varwidth=TRUE)
```

--- .class #id

## Another binning

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds2, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_number(carat, 20))   , varwidth=TRUE)
```


--- .class #id

## Another binning

```{r scatter-binned-2, echo=F}
ggplot(data = diamonds2,  aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_number(carat, 20)))
```


--- .class #id

## Differences

- `cut(x, width)` divides the `x` axis variable by the `width`. 
- `varwidth` increases the width of the boxplot based on the number of points contained in the summary. 
- `cutnumber` cuts the data up into a pre-specified number of points.
