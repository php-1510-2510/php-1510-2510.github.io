# The `spread()` Function

--- .class #id


## The `spread()` Function

- The first `tidyr` function we will look into is the `spread()` function. 
- With `spread()` it does similar to what you would expect.  
- We have a data frame where some of the rows contain information that is really a variable name. 
- This means the columns are a combination of variable names as well as some data. 

--- .class #id


## What does it do?

The picture below displays this:

<img src="./assets/img/tidy-spread.png" style="height:100%;width:80%">
</center>


--- .class #id

## Consider this Data:



```{r, echo=FALSE}
table2
```

--- .class #id

## `key` column

- Notice that in the column of `key`, instead of there being values we see the following variable names:
    - cases
    - population

--- .class #id

## What Should we see?

- In order to use this data we need to have it so the data frame looks like this instead:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
spread(table2, key, value)
```

--- .class #id

## Using the `spread()` Function

- Now we can see that we have all the columns representing the variables we are interested in and each of the rows is now a complete observation. 
- In order to do this we need to learn about the `spread()` function:

--- .class #id

## The `spread()` Function

```
spread(data, key, value)
```

- Where
    - `data` is your dataframe of interest. 
    - `key` is the column whose values will become variable names. 
    - `value` is the column where values will fill in under the new variables created from `key`. 

--- .class #id

## Piping

- If we consider **piping**, we can write this as:

```
data %>%
  spread(key, value)
```

--- .class #id

## `spread()` Example


- Now if we consider table2 , we can see that we have:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
table2
```

--- .class #id

## `spread()` Example

- Now this table was made for this example so key is the `key` in our `spread()` function and value is the `value` in our `spread()` function.
- We can fix this with the following code:

--- .class #id

## `spread()` Example

```{R}
table2 %>%
    spread(key,value)
```

--- .class #id

## `spread()` Example

- We can now see that we have a variable named `cases` and a variable named `population`. 
- This is much more tidy. 







--- .class #id

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice 

- In this example we will use the dataset `population` that is part of tidyverse. 
- Print this data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
head(population,1)
```

--- .class #id

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice 

- You should see the table that we have above, now We have a variable named `year`, assume that we wish to actually have each year as its own variable. 
- Using the `spread()` function, redo this data so that each year is a variable. 
- Your data will look like this at the end:


--- .class #id

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice

```{r, echo=FALSE}
population %>% spread(year, population)
```


---  .segue bg:grey


# The `gather()` Function


--- .class #id


## The `gather()` Function

- The second `tidyr` function we will look into is the `gather()` function. 
- With `gather()` it may not be clear what exactly is going on, but in this case we actually have a lot of column names the represent what we would like to have as data values. 

--- .class #id



<center>
<img src="./assets/img/tidy-gather.png" style="height:100%;width:80%">
</center>


--- .class #id


## The `gather()` Function Example


- For example, in the last `spread()` practice you created a data frame where variable names were individual years. 
- This may not be what you want to have so you can use the gather function. 


--- .class #id


## Consider `table4`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
table4

```

--- .class #id

## Table 4

- This looks similar to the table you created in the `spread()` practice.
- We now wish to change this data frame so that `year` is a variable and 1999 and 2000 become values instead of variables. 

--- .class #id


## In Comes the `gather()` Function

- We will accomplish this with the gather function:

```
gather(data, key, value, ...)
```
- where
    - `data` is the data frame you are working with. 
    - `key` is the name of the `key` column to create.
    - `value` is the name of the `value` column to create.
    - `...` is a way to specify what columns to gather from. 

--- .class #id


## `gather()` Example

- In our example here we would do the following:

```{R}
table4 %>%
    gather("year", "cases", 2:3)
```

--- .class #id

## `gather()` Example

- You can see that we have created 2 new columns called `year` and `cases`. 
- We filled these with the previous 2nd and 3rd columns. 
- Note that we could have done this in many different ways too. 


--- .class #id

## `gather()` Example

- For example if we knew the years but not which columns we could do this:

```
table4 %>%
    gather("year", "cases", "1999":"2000")
```

- We could also see that we want to gather all columns except the first so we could have used:

```
table4 %>%
    gather("year", "cases", -1)
```


--- .class #id

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice

- Create `population2` from last example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
population 2 <- population %>% 
                    spread(year, population)
```

- Now gather the columns that are labeled by year and create columns `year` and `population`. 


--- .class #id

## On Your Own: RStudio Practice


In the end your data frame should look like:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
head(population,2)
```
