## Grading:


-Students will be evaluated based on:


| Grade  | Category | Percentage |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Participation       |                    10%   |
| Homework             |                   20%  | 
| Exam 1 (03/13/2019)   |                  20% | 
| Exam 2 (05/8/2019)  |                 20%  |
| Reproducible Research Project  |           30% |

## Participation

* This course will move very fast and it is crucial to success in the course that students attend and participate. 
* Unexcused absences will result in a loss of percentage points. 


--- .class #id

## Homework

* Assignments will be given out to students. Assignments will require data handling, data cleaning and interpretation of the results.  
* It is expected that all assignments are completed on time. No late assignments will be accepted. 
* Students will also be graded on the conciseness and quality of work. 
* Turning in many pages of just computer code and output will affect the grade in a negative fashion.
* All work must be done in R. No other Stat software is accepted. 

--- .class #id

## Exam 1 (March 13, 2019)

* An in class exam will be given. 
* Students will be expected to interpret and analyze regression models. 
* Students will also be expected to understand conceptual ideas. 


--- .class #id


## Exam  2 (May 8, 2019)

* An in class exam will be given. 
* Students will be expected to interpret and analyze regression models. 
* Students will also be expected to understand conceptual ideas.

## Reproducible Research Project

Students will spend the semester working on a Reproducible Research Project. This project will require:

1. Asking a relevant public Health question for those in 2511 and a relevant scientific question for those in 1511. 
2. Identify available data to answer this question. 
3. Model the question with appropriate statistical models. 
4. Write up a report with appropriate tables, graphs and results. 


--- .class #id


## Reproducible Research Project


* The project will consist of individual as well as group content. 
* For the individual content you will complete the 4 requirements. 
* For the group component. You will work in small groups to evaluate each others work. 
* This will require:
    1. Constructive Criticism of Group members Projects based on Course Content. 
    2. In depth review of group members work. 
* You will be graded on both individual and group aspects. 
* It is important to learn not only how to ask a public health question and answer that question with a study or data but equally important to review others work and arguments.

## PHP 1511: Specifics

| Grade Category | Comments | 
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Participation  |                 Graded the same as all students, Must be in class and prepared to work in groups.  |
| Homework        |                Students will be expected to complete a portion of the material with the exception of some more difficult problems which may be attempted but do not have to be complete. | 
| Exam 1 & 2              |        Students will be expected to complete a portion of the exam.  |
| Reproducible Research Project |  Students will be expected to complete a reproducible research project. Data as well as questions explored will be at a level appropriate of the background and other statistical courses taken. This will be a semester long project so it will require a great deal of work. |

## Statistical Analysis


* We will use R as a programming language for data analysis and use   existing packages written in R to support the course. 
* You should have access to a laptop   or desktop capable of running [R or RStudio]({{site.baseurl}}/resources).  
* We will also provide access   to a dedicated server running RStudio Pro for all students that will have a unified environment.  
* See the [Resources]({{site.baseurl}}/resources) page for books and other resources for learning R.

## Email and Discussion Forums

* We will be using [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/php15112511sp-uym3228/shared_invite/enQtNTI5OTM4MzczMTY5LWRkMzdjODdjODc0MjRhNzVhMWU5OGUyZTE3NTE2YWUyYjk0ZjVmZGJjMDAzODA1MDBmMWZiODM5ZTA5YjcxOWU) for class discussion. 
* The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. 
* Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Slack (peer answers earn participation points!). 
* Any non-personal questions related to the material covered in class, problem sets, labs, projects, etc. should be posted on slack.
* Before posting a new question please make sure to check if your question has already been answered. 
* The TAs and myself will be answering questions on the forum daily and all students are expected to answer questions as well. Please use informative titles for your posts.

## What Slack does not mean: 

* This does not mean that the professor or staff will be available 24/7.
* Do not expect a fast answer from the staff after 5pm on a week night. 
* Do not expect a fast answer from the staff on the weekends.

## Students with Special Needs


* Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all students. 
* Students who, by nature of a documented disability, require academic accommodations should contact the professor during office hours.
* Students may also speak with Student and Employee Accessibility Services at 401-863-9588 to discuss the process for requesting accommodations.

## Diversity Statement

* This course is designed to support an inclusive learning environment where diverse perspectives are recognized, respected and seen as a source of strength. 
* It is our intent to provide materials and activities that are respectful of various levels of diversity: mathematical background, previous computing skills, gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture.  
* It is the nature of data analysis that we will touch on sensitive subjects. 
* My goal will be to approach these with as much respect and kindness as I can. 
* Please come see me if you ever feel hurt or upset about class discussions.

## English Language Learners

*  Brown University welcomes students from around the world, and the unique perspectives international students bring enrich the campus community.  *  To empower students whose first language is not English, an array of ELL support is available on campus including language and culture workshops and individual appointments. 
* For more information about English Language Learning at Brown, contact the ELL Specialists at ellwriting@brown.edu.
