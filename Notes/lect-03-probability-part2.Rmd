# Counting

knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE)

## Counting

- We will discuss counting with the following methods:
    - Multiplication Rule
    - Permutations
    - Combinations
    


--- .class #id

## Multiplication Rule 

- We have seen this rule play out already. 
- Consider 1 die:
    - Our Sample Space is:
    - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- With 2 die:
    - The sample space became size 36. 


--- .class #id

## Multiplication Rule

- For 2 trials:
    - Trial one has $n_1$ ways of happening. 
    - Trial two has $n_2$ ways of happening.
    - Then the total number of ways the for the 2 trials to happen together is:
  
  $$ N=n_1*n_2$$


--- .class #id

## Multiplication Rule

- This is because for each number on the first die you could roll 6 numbers on the second die. 
- The picture below shows how this works
  
![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6fe0ee70e3ca357140d0f4489e0cfb3f-c)


--- .class #id

## General Multiplication Rule

- In general, if we assume that we have `r` decisions to be made. 
- If there are $n_1$ ways to decide Decision 1, $n_2$ ways to decide Decision 2, and so on
- The total number of ways to make all `r` decisions is:
$$N = n_1*n_2\cdots n_r$$


--- .class #id

## More Counting

- What if we wanted to know how many ways there are to throw 5 heads in 10 coin tosses? 
- What if we wanted to know how many ways there are to take 9 cell cultures and split 3 into a treatment group and 6 into a control? 
- These are more complicated ways of counting and we need to talk about permutations and combinations to do this. 



--- .class #id 

## Permutations

- A permutation is a way of understanding how many ways there are to arrnge objects. 
- Consider a race with 9 individuals. 
- Furthermore we are going to give medals to the first 3 places only. 
- How many ways are there for this race to go? 

--- .class #id

## Permutations

- We have 9 ways for first place, then it leaves 8 for second and finally 7 left for third.
- This means we have:
  
$$9\times8\times7 =504$$

- This also is equal to:
  
$$\dfrac{9!}{(9-3)!}=\dfrac{9!}{6!} = \dfrac{9*8*7*6!}{6!} = 9*8*7$$


--- .class #id

## Permutations

- Generally speaking, if we wish to arrange `r` objects out of `N` objects, the number of ways to do this is:
  
$$\dfrac{N!}{(N-r)!}$$

where, 

$$N! = N\times (N-1) \times (N-2) \times (N-3) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$$

--- class #id

## Combinations 

- What happens if we do not care about how things are ordered? 
- Consider if instead of 9 racers, we have 9 cell cultures and we wish to treat three of them in a certain manner. 
- Now the order of them doesn't matter. 
- We have something similar to a permutation here but we need to get rid of the ordering. 
    - Consider the 3 elements, we can order them in the following ways:

$$ 3\times2\times1 = 3!$$

--- .class #id

## Combinations

- We know then if we care about ordering that we have:
  
$$\dfrac{9!}{(9-3)!}=\dfrac{9!}{6!} = \dfrac{9*8*7*6!}{6!} = 9*8*7=504 \text{ ways}$$

- Then we would have to divided these ways by the $3!$ repeats. 
- Giving us:

$$\dfrac{9!}{(9-3)!3!}=\dfrac{9!}{6!3!} = \dfrac{9*8*7*6!}{6!3!} = \dfrac{9*8*7}{3*2*1}=3*4*7=84 \text{ ways}$$


--- .class #id

## Combinations

- Generally speaking, if we wish to choose `r` objects out of `N` objects, the number of ways to do this is:
  
$$\dfrac{N!}{(N-r)!r!}$$

where, 

$$N! = N\times (N-1) \times (N-2) \times (N-3) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$$

--- .class #id

## Combinations vs Permutations

- Both count the number of ways to pick from a larger number of objects. 
- Permutations are picking when order matters. 
- Combinations are for when order does not matter.

## Conditional Probability

![xkcd.com](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/conditional_risk.png)


--- .class #id

## Conditional Probability

- We have talked about simple scenarios where nothing outside of the problem matters. 
- What happens if you flip a coin with different hands? 
- What happens if you choose cell cultures that were prepared by different people? 
- Do these things matter?
- How does the probability change?

--- .class #id

## Conditional Probability 

- Conditional probability imposes a restriction.  
- If we condition on something, then our sample space changes and our probability might as well. 
- This is easiest seen with cards but we can imagine other things to avoid increasing your chances of a gambling addiction. 
- Consider a box of donuts, there are 5 plain donuts, 5 glazed, and 2 jelly. (*Important real life problem*) 

--- .class #id

## Conditional Probability 

- We can calculate your probabilites using R:

```{r}
T <- 100000
donut <- rep(c("plain", "glazed", "jelly"), times=c(5,5,2))
test <- replicate(T, sample(donut,1))
prop.table(table(test))
```

--- .class #id

## Conditional Probability

- Now being the "nice" person I am, I give one of you a jelly donut. 
- Now the probability that another person gets a jelly donut is conditional on the fact that I got rid of one already. 

```{r}
donut <- rep(c("plain", "glazed", "jelly"), times=c(5,5,2))
test <- replicate(T, sample(donut[-12],1))
prop.table(table(test))
```


--- .class #id

## Why Conditional Probability? 

- We already know that many factors come into play when it comes to health:
    - Age
    - Race
    - Sex
    - Gender
    - Socioeconomics
    - etc...
- As soon as we need to consider these factors we are conditioning our model on these characteristics.




--- .class #id

## Conditional Probability

$$Pr(B|A) = \dfrac{Pr(A\cap B)}{Pr(A)}$$

- Consider the probability of getting a jelly donut given I already gave one away: 

```{r}
a <- 2/12
b_a <- 1/11
cond <- (a*b_a)/a
cond
```

--- .class #id

## Recall

- We were close with simulation and it was much easier


```{r}
donut <- rep(c("plain", "glazed", "jelly"), times=c(5,5,2))
test <- replicate(T, sample(donut[-12],1))
prop.table(table(test))
```

- ***See now you don't mind using R, since I could make you do so many fun math formulas instead***



--- .class #id

## Further Simulations

- A die is rolled until the first time that a number comes up twice.
- What is the probability that the die is rolled three times?
- 121 and 455 would work. 
- 112 and 554 would not work. 
- Can you imagine how this would play out with formulas? 
- Can you easily see a way to do count the number of ways for this to happen? 

--- .class #id

## One Possible Solution

- We use R. 
    - Roll 3 die. 
    - The 3rd die can be equal to either the first or the second. 
    - The 1st and 2nd cannot be equal. 
    - If those 2 things hold then we had same number twice in three rolls. 
- Run this simulation over and over again. 

--- .class #id

## With R

```{r}
set.seed(123)
successes <- 0
trials <- 10000

for(i in 1:trials) {
  DieRoll <- sample(6,3,TRUE)
  if(DieRoll[3] %in% DieRoll[1:2] && !(DieRoll[2] == DieRoll[1])) 
    successes <- successes + 1
}

print(successes/trials)
```



--- .class #id

## By Hand

- We have 6 ways to choose the first die. 
- Then since the first cannot equal the second we have 5 ways to choose that. 
- Then:
    - if the third matches the first there is 1 way to do that. (30 Ways)
    - If the third matches the second there is 1 way to do that. (30 Ways)
- So 60 ways together. 
- Then for 3 die, there are $6*6*6=216$ ways to roll. 
- This gives us $\dfrac{60}{216}=0.27777778$


--- .class #id

## Conditional Simulations

- In the lab video I will go over further simulations for this. 
- These are harder to simulate but worthwhile to work through.
