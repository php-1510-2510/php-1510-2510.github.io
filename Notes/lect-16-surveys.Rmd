# Random Sampling


--- .class #id

## Random Sampling

- Simple Random Sampling is where each member of the population has the same probability of being sampled. 
- The goal is to produce a representative sample that does not have problems with selection bias. 



--- .class #id

## Sampling Error and Bias

- Sampling error is the inherent error that is a produce of the variation of different samples. 
    - Can change with survey design.
    - Clustering and Stratification add further errors and bias in. 
- Bias:  Difference between estimator's value based on sample and the true value of the
population parameter being estimated. 
    - An estimate is biased if the *center* of it's distribution is not the population mean.

# Why Surveys


--- .class #id

## Why Surveys

- Randomly sampling from populations can be extremely expensive
- Many times you also want to guarantee that you reach certain parts of population that you you are concerned about having enough information on. 
- We use Surveys to save cost and make sure we hear from specific subpopulations we are interested in.



--- .class #id


## Types of Survey Data


- **Stratified Sampling** - Sample across different strata to make representative. 
- **Cluster Sampling** - Sample across clusters, for example neighborhoods. 
- **Weighted Sampling** - You may choose to oversample from important subpopulations, for example ethnic minorities or impoverished neighborhoods. 




--- .class #id


## How Does this Change our Analysis?

- We can no longer assume that everyone has an equal probability of being selected. 
- We assume that we know a certain probability of being selected, $\pi_i$ for each individual. 
- We then need to weight based on this $\pi_i$



--- .class #id

## How Does this Change our Anaysis?

- For example if we randomly sample from the population a good estimate for the total sample size is simple
\[T_x = \sum_{i=1}^N x_i\]
- For a survey we sampled based on unequal probabilities
\[T_X = \sum_{i=1}^N \dfrac{1}{\pi_i}x_i\]




--- .class #id


## What else does this effect?

- We no longer get the correct estimate of variance.
- We need to adjust things like means for the new total population. 



--- .class #id

## Methods for Variance?

- We could estimate variances using:
    - delta method
    - jackknife
    - bootstrap
    - Other resampling tools




--- .class #id


## What Do we Do?

- We can no longer use regular summary, regression or even graphic techniques. 
- Each person does not count as 1 anymore in this data. 
- Luckily statistical software has been created to deal with these issues. 



--- .class #id

## What Do we Need to Know?

- Describing your survey design. 
- Summary Statistics
- Tables
- Graphics
- Regression Modeling
- Calibration

# The `survey` package in R



--- .class #id

## Enter the `survey` Package in R

- The survey package in R has been built to handle survey data.
- It can do all of the procedures above. 
- It can also work directly with databases for connecting to surveys stored in databases. 



--- .class #id


## Describing the Design

```
library(survey)
brfss.design <- svydesign(data=brfss, nest=TRUE,
weight= ~llcpwt,id= ~psu, strata= ~ststr) 
```

- `data` the data for your survey.
- `nest` if your data needs to be relabeled due to nesting.
- `weight` weights for the specific sampling.
- `id` unique ids for the sampling groups. 
- `strata` strata that weights and ids refer to. 



--- .class #id

## Enter BRFSS Data

- BRFSS is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
- This is a national health-related telephone survey. 
- There are more than 400,000 interviews done every year from all 50 states and the district of Columbia. 
- To learn more about this survey please go to their website: [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/).
