### Description



Intensive first course in biostatistical methodology, focusing on problems arising in public health, life sciences, and biomedical disciplines. Summarizing and representing data; basic probability; fundamentals of inference; hypothesis testing; likelihood methods. Inference for means and proportions; linear regression and analysis of variance; basics of experimental design; nonparametrics; logistic regression. Open to advanced undergraduates with permission from the instructor.


This course provides a survey of basic probability and statistical tools for modeling data.  Emphasis is on developing a conceptual understanding of the application of these techniques to solving problems, rather than to the numerical details. Extensive use of the computer will be made for analysis of datasets.



This course is designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate students who will be analyzing data with scientific colleagues and who want to develop a practical hands-on toolkit and gain experience in distilling complex statistical information into formats understandable to colleagues. This course will feature R programming elements. To make the most of R students will be expected to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). There are videos on the course's R page to explain how to get set up and started in RStudio. We will also be using [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) for further R instruction through the semester.
