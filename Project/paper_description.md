# Basics of Paper

Your paper should between 5 and 10 pages long. This includes any tables, figures or appendices. The basic layout of the paper will be as follows:

1. Background/Introduction
2. Methods used in Replication and Extension
3. Replication Results
4. Extension Results
5. Conclusion

Make note that this paper should be well written and the tables and figures should be of publishable quality. This represents almost a semester worth or work. 


## 1. Background/Introduction

This section will be different from a traditional background. Your goal is to describe why you chose the paper you are replicating and what this paper brings to your field of interest. You will then introduce your extension of this and what your extension will accomplish and add to the research. 


## 2. Methods use in Replication and Extension

It is important for a paper of this nature to describe the tools which you used in order to replicate and extend the paper. This is not the place to discuss the results but the tools in which you used to arrive at them. Take time to describe:

- Statistical Methods used.
- R packages used.
- Any further methods used to arrive at results. 

## 3. Replication Results

Display your results and then discuss how they compare and contrast to the original paper. Pay particular attention to the differences and discuss any intuition you have in terms of how they are different. If you were unable to get things to match, consider the following questions:

- Do me results suggest similar effects? 
- Were my results different in direction, magnitude or both?

## 4. Extension Results 

Take time to discuss the nature of your extension and the results of it. Your extension should add something significant to the research and allow for a more thorough understanding. Please describe what led you to extend the work in this particular direction. Then display and discuss the results. Consider the following questions:

- What does this extension add?
- Does the extension change the results or is it similar to the original research. 

## 5. Conclusion

In the conclusion wrap the paper up with a discussion of what you have learned from this research and in general about the replication and extension. Make sure to address any flaws or weaknesses that your work might have and what could be done to address them.
