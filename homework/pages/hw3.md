This is your third homework assignment. Please start the assignment early so you can get help if you need it. You are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates just follow the instructions and make sure the write up is yours. 

**Note the specific instructions: ** *You are encouraged to discuss problem sets with your fellow students (and with the Course Instructor of course), but you must write your own final answers, in your own words. Solutions prepared ``in committee'' or by copying someone else's paper are not acceptable.  This violates the Brown standards of plagiarism, and you will not have the benefit of having thought about and worked the problem when you take the examinations.*

*All answers must be in complete sentences and all graphs must be properly labeled.*

***In this homework you will be required to use .Rmd to do it., you can then knit to a word document or PDF to turn it in.***
